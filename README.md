# SCP: Secret Fortress

SCP: Secret Fortress is a gamemode for Team Fortress 2 inspired by the game [SCP: Secret Labortory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory/ "SCP: Secret: Laboratory on Steam"). It contains many elements that differ from normal TF2 such as the ability to pick up serveral different items and weapons, using no weapon slots and custom ammo types.

Alterative gamemodes can be created using the same plugin, some ones already made includes SCP-3008-1 survival game using a custom map and [SCP: Pandemic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/872670/SCP_Pandemic_Early_Access/ "SCP: Pandemic (Early Access) on Steam") using [Super Zombie Fortress](https://github.com/redsunservers/SuperZombieFortress "redsunservers/SuperZombieFortress: Custom Team Fortress 2 Gamemode, inspired from Left 4 Dead") (szf) maps.

## Compatibility Notice

This plugin uses different features which may cause some other plugins to misbehave:
- Uses it's own chat processor for proximity chat which causes other chat processors to not function (See scp_sf.inc about SCPSF_CanTalkTo)
- Team 0 (Unassigned) is used as a playable team (Check if a player is alive along with team check)
- Pop up menus during gameplay can be negative to weapon switching
- Player's class swap often for plugins that may check one time
- Without SendProxy can cause trippy viewmodels
- Custom model plugins may not function at all
